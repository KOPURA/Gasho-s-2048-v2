# Gasho's 2048 V2

A project for the Multimedia Applications course @ New Bulgarian University.

This project is my interpretation of the classic 2048 game.

The original version of the game can be found [here](https://play2048.co/). 


Preliminary Plan:
  - CSS3 to be used for the styling of the different components
  - jQuery to be used for implemetation of the different animations
